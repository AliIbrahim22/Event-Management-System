## Introduction  

When using the Event Management System, you can access and modify your events. The system simply acts as a central repository for individuals or managers to store and handle events and related information. An Event Management System reduces the number of processes required to handle your events, making the administrative process considerably more efficient. Users have the ability to change or remove events as well as the information associated with them. They can add a new event to the system and search for a specific event. 
Users can use a set of RESTful service endpoints, a simple UI, or both to communicate with Event-Management-System.

## Requirments  

## Scenario  1

As a manager I want to be able to edit an event's information, so that I have the updated information on my events stored in my database.  

#### Examples  

##### 1.1

**Given**: An event's information is available.    

Example\  id(4),Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's 50st Birthday!!").  

**When**: The manager selects edit next to the event they would like to edit, and edits the Description to "It is Sam's (CEO) 32st Birthday!!". 

**Then**: Then edited information of the event is updated in the database.     

Example \  id(4),Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's (CEO) 50st  Birthday!!").  

##### 1.2

**Given**: An event's information is available.

Example\  Id(4),Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's (CEO) 50st Birthday!!").

**When**: The manager selects edit next to the event they would like to edit, and edits the Name to an empty string "".

**Then**: Then data is not updated in the database and manager receives an error message .

Example \  Id(4),Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's (CEO) 50st Birthday!!").

## Scenario 2 

As a manager I want to be able to delete an event, so that the event's information is deleted from my database.  

#### Examples 

##### 2.1

**Given**: An event's information is available.

**When**: The manager selects delete next to the event they would like to delete.    

Example \  Id(4), Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's (CEO) 50st Birthday!!").

**Then**: Then manager can delete the event, and it is deleted from the database.   

##### 2.2

**Given**: An event's information is available.

**When**: The manager selects delete next to the event they would like to delete, and internet connection is lost.

Example \  Id(4), Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's (CEO) 50st Birthday!!").

**Then**: Then the event is not deleted from the database.

## Scenario 3 

As a manager I want to be able to add a new event, so that I can store the event information in my database.  

#### Examples

##### 3.1

**Given**: A new event tab is available.

**When**: The manager selects the new event tab, fills the form that shows up, and submits the form.  

Example \  Name("Monthly Office Event"),Address("456 Salt Rd., Sydney, Ohio, USA"), Date(04/25/2022), Time(4:00 pm), Description("Office monthly happy hour - Bowling").

**Then**: The event information is saved as a new record in the database.    

Example \  Id(5),Name("Monthly Office Event"),Address("456 Salt Rd., Sydney, Ohio, USA"), Date(04/25/2022), Time(4:00 pm), Description("Office monthly happy hour - Bowling").  

##### 3.2

**Given**: A new event tab is available.

**When**: The manager selects the new event tab, fills the form that shows up, and submits the form without providing a date.

Example \  Name("Monthly Office Event"),Address("456 Salt Rd., Sydney, Ohio, USA"), Date(), Time(4:00 pm), Description("Office monthly happy hour - Bowling").

**Then**: The event information is not sent to the server, and the event is not stored in the database.

## Scenario  4

As a manager I want to be able to specifically search for an event, so that I can preview that events information that is in my database.  

#### Examples  

##### 4.1

**Given**: A search bar is available.

**When**: The manager enters the event name.    

Example \  Name("Birthday"). 

**Then**: Then manager can preview the information of the event that is in the database.    

Example \  Name("Birthday"),Address("567 Main St., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"), Date(01/28/2022), Time(5:00 pm), Description("It is Sam's (CEO) 50st Birthday!!")    

##### 4.2

**Given**: A search bar is available.

**When**: The manager searches for a Name that does not exist in the databse.

Example \  Name("Event 234").

**Then**: No event data is retrieved from the database.

**EventManagmentSystemApplication** - The class that starts the Spring Boot application.

**EventController** - This is the class that handles all incoming requests, and sends them to the correct service and method. When the response data is ready the controller sends the response back to the requester.


**IEventService** - An interface that provides the criteria for the required methods any implementing service class must implement.

**EventServiceStub** - A demo class holding hardcoded data to allow the front-end to start their work in parallel to the backend development.

**EventService** - The actual service that uses real dynamic data from a data source, and performs business logic before returning data to the controller.

#### DAO:
**IEventDAO** - An interfacer. The implementing class handles all the CRUD operations with the data source related to the Event entity or table.  

**EventRepository** - We'll need code for the data access layer, so we'll create an EventRepository interface. We created an interface that extends the CrudRepository interface and has CRUD methods like save(), findAll(), findById(), deleteById(), and so on. Spring JPA generates the implementation codeÂ at runtime.  


#### DTO:
**Event** - An interfacer. The implementing class is used as an object to carry around Event data between different parts of the application. 

### JSON Schema

>       "description" : {
>          "type" : "string" 
>       },
